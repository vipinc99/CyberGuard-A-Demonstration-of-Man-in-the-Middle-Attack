Nowadays cyberattack is a stern illegal crime and it is one of the most commonly discussed issues. An unauthorised third party who joins an internet conversation between two users and stays hidden between them is known as a Man in the Middle Attack (MIM). This problem is severe, and the majority of cryptographic systems that lack adequate verification security are susceptible to malware known as Man in the Middle Attack. A variety of activities, such as fraud, unauthorised support exchanges, or unauthorised watchword changes, might be carried out using information obtained during an attack. Through MIM, a malevolent party may transmit, receive, and disrupt data intended for parties other than the ones involved in the interaction. An intruder inside the system known as a man-in-the-middle attack has the ability to contact, read, and alter confidential data while leaving no evidence of their actions. We've included some methods for identifying man in the middle attacks and simple instructions for users to follow in order to avoid these attacks both now and in the future, as security is everyone's top priority.
